# AWS Rekognition Image Text Detection Project

This project tests the capabilities of **AWS Rekognition**.

The website is hosted on **EC2** and allows users to select an image. Upon uploading the image to **S3**, it triggers a **Lambda function**, which then invokes **Rekognition** to detect the text in the image.
